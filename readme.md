# HealthCareMicroservices

This repository contains the **microservices-based architecture** for the HealthCare system. It is designed to scale various modules independently while offering the same functionality as the monolithic version with improved modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

> üí° You can also check out the [HealthCareBackend (Monolithic Version)](https://github.com/amanyara21/HealthCareBackend) for a simpler, all-in-one implementation.

## üß™ How to Run

> You can run each service individually, but a recommended setup is to start them in this order:

1. **Config Server**
```bash
cd config-server
./gradlew bootRun
````

2. **Eureka Server**

```bash
cd eureka-server
./gradlew bootRun
```

3. **API Gateway**

```bash
cd api-gateway
./gradlew bootRun
```

4. **Core Microservices (in any order after above)**

```bash
cd user-service
./gradlew bootRun

cd doctor-service
./gradlew bootRun

cd appointment-service
./gradlew bootRun

cd health-record-service
./gradlew bootRun

cd admin-service
./gradlew bootRun
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Each microservice fetches configuration from the **Config Server**, which pulls from a Git-based config repo.

Ensure your `application.yml` in each service points to:

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
```

---

## üîê Security

* All services use **JWT-based authentication** via the API Gateway.
* Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
